# Running the application

The only thing left to do is run our application. 

Let's first start up our server. If all goes well, we should 
see the following output in the Run toolwindow of IntelliJ IDEA
(or from the console)

![Server Run](./assets/server-run.png)

Now that the server is running, we can execute the client and start sending some
messages to the server


![Client Run](./assets/client-run.png)

As expected, the server will return the message the client
sent to it, along with the client identifier. 

If we were to run multiple clients, we'd see the output from all clients. That
can be left as an exercise!
