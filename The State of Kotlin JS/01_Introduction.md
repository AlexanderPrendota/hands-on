These are supplementary materials for the talk ["The State of Kotlin/JS"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4A5eR4rD_U&feature=youtu.be&t=10468) from KotlinConf 2019. **You can expect more standalone learning materials regarding Kotlin/JS in early 2020**.

It is undeniable that "the web" and with it JavaScript is one of the more influential targets for end user software in the recent decade – especially if you want to roll out an application to a bunch of users and don’t want to think about the specific platforms they use, building for the web is a viable go-to solution. Using the JavaScript target for Kotlin, you can achieve the same thing, while benefiting from the characteristics of Kotlin.

In this hands-on we will see in the context of a few smaller examples, how we can reuse our knowledge about language paradigms, syntax, and tooling to build applications for modern browsers as well as the Node.js platform.

From the start of a new project over painting some colorful squares, we'll explore how different parts of Kotlin/JS work. The short examples in this hands-on should serve as a jumping-off point for your own, deeper exploration of the topic.

Enough talk – let's start by creating our first project!
