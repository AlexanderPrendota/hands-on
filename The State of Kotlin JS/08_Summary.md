# Summary

```warning
These are supplementary materials for the talk ["The State of Kotlin/JS"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4A5eR4rD_U&feature=youtu.be&t=10468) from KotlinConf 2019. **You can expect more standalone learning materials regarding Kotlin/JS in early 2020**.
```

In this hands-on, we have seen a few topics that serve as the jumping-off points to exploring Kotlin/JS. We've seen how a project is set up using the `kotlin.js` Gradle plugin, how to write a first simple "Hello World" application for the browser, how to interact with the ecosystem, and how to write tests.

There are of course many more topics that could be covered in-depth. Check back regularily to catch the latest updates to our Kotlin hands-on tutorials, and see which new topics are covered.

For now, if you would like to learn more about Kotlin/JS, feel free to refer to the [documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/js-overview.html).
