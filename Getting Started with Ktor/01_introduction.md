# Introduction

[Ktor](https://ktor.io) is an application framework for creating connected systems. It can be used for
developing both client and server-side applications. While the Ktor project aims to be multiplatform and can be used to target the JVM, JavaScript and/or Native, server functionality is only 
currently available on the JVM.

In this tutorial we're going to see how to create and run a simple HTTP application that serves an endpoint.
