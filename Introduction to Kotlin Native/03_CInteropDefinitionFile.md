# Interoperating with C Libraries

When writing native applications, we often need to access certain functionality that is not included in the Kotlin standard library, 
such as making HTTP requests, reading and writing from disk, etc. 

Kotlin/Native provides us with the ability to consume standard C libraries, opening up an entire ecosystem of functionality that exists 
for pretty much anything we could need. In fact, Kotlin/Native already ships with a set of prebuilt [platform libraries](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/blob/master/PLATFORM_LIBS.md) which 
provide some additional common functionality to that of the standard library. 

An ideal scenario for interop is to call C functions as if we were calling Kotlin functions, that is, following the same signature and conventions. This is precisely what the 
`cinterop` tool provides us with. It takes a C library and generates the corresponding Kotlin bindings for it, which then allows us
to use the library as if it were Kotlin code. 

In order to generate these bindings, we need to create a library definition `.def` file that contains some information about the headers we need to generate. In our case we want to use the famous `libcurl` library
to make some HTTP calls.

## Create the definition file
 
Create a file named `libcurl.def` with the following contents

```c
headers = curl/curl.h
headerFilter = curl/*

compilerOpts.linux = -I/usr/include -I/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu
linkerOpts.osx = -L/opt/local/lib -L/usr/local/opt/curl/lib -lcurl
linkerOpts.linux = -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -lcurl
```

and place it under your project directory in a new subfolder under `src` called **nativeInterop/cinterop**. Note that this is the default convention for header file locations, albeit it can be overriden 
in the `build.gradle` file if you use a different location. 

The first entry is `headers` which is the list of header files that we want to generate 
Kotlin stubs for. We can add multiple files to this entry, separating each one with a `\` on a new line. In our case we only want `curl.h`. The files we are referencing
need to be relative to the folder where the definition file is, or be available on the system path (in our case it would be `/usr/include/curl`).

The second line is the `headerFilter`. This is used to denote what exactly we want included. In C, when one file references another file with the `#include` directive, 
all the headers are also included. Sometimes this may not be needed, and we can use this parameter, [using glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)), to fine tune things. 
Note, that `headerFilter` is an optional argument and mostly only used when the library we're using is being installed as a system library, and we do not want to fetch external dependencies 
(such as system `stdint.h` header) into our interop library. It may be important for both optimizing the library size and fixing potential conflicts between the system and the Kotlin/Native provided compilation environment.

The next lines are about providing linker and compiler options, which can vary depending on different target platforms. In our case, we are defining it for macOS (the `.osx` suffix) and Linux (the `.linux` suffix).
Parameters without a suffix is also possible (e.g. `linkerOpts=`) and will be applied to all platforms. 

The convention that is followed is that each library gets its own definition file, usually named the same as the library. For more information on all
the options available to `cinterop`, see [the Interop documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/native/c_interop.html)

Once we have the definition file ready, we can 
create project files and open the project in an IDE.


**Important**

```note
You need to have the `curl` library binaries on your system. On macOS and Linux, it is usually included. On Windows
you can build it from [sources](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html). Alternatively, you may also want to consider a [MinGW/MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) `curl` binary.
```
