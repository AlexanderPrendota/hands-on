# Kotlin Multiplatform Projects

In the tutorial we will learn how to create a Kotlin Multiplatform project
to set up code reuse between client side JavaScript application and the
server-side JVM applications. Throughout the tutorial we will
implement the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
and see how our JVM-only solution can be turned into a fully functional
Kotlin multiplatform project.
