# Creating JavaScript Target

We've tried calling different URLs from the JVM backend to see
different [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)
images, like that one

It is a bit hard to deal with the 2D space coordinates manually,
and our goal is to create a more user-friendly HTML interface
for that. 

We'll do the client-side JavaScript application entirely with Kotlin/JS. Our first step
is to add an HTML page in several lines of Kotlin using the 
[kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html) library.


```note
We are using experimantal Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle plugin
with the experimental Kotlin/JS support. Right now it
may not fully support running on Windows operation system. 
[Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)
or Docker can be used as workarounds
```

## Adding Gradle Target

We need to add the `js()` target into the `build.gradle.kts` file
in the `kotlin{..}` block. The resulting block should look like that

```kotlin
kotlin {
  jvm()
  js {
    browser()
  }
}
```

## Adding Kotlin/JS Dependencies

Now it is time to add Kotlin/JS dependencies to the project by
adding the following code to the `build.gradle.kts` project file:

```kotlin
kotlin.sourceSets["jsMain"].dependencies {
  implementation(kotlin("stdlib-js"))
  implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-html-js:0.6.12")
}
```

We've just added a dependency to the Kotlin standard library and
HTML DSL library to our Kotlin/JS source set.

We may need to refresh the Gradle project model now to make sure
the IDE sees all our project model changes. Let's click on the _refresh_
icon in the Gradle tab to accomplish this.

## Adding index.html

Yet another preparation step is to add the `index.html`
to the project. Let's create the 
`src/jsMain/resources/index.html` file on our project
with the following contents
```html
<html lang="en">
<body>
  <div id="app">Loading...</div>
  <script src="kotlin-fractals2-handson.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
We can include CSS to the HTML file to make the page look better in the browser.
You can check out the 'step-003' branch of the
[github.com/kotlin-hands-on/intro-mpp](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/intro-mpp)
repository for more insights.

## Rendering HTML from Kotlin/JS

Let's render the basic HTML using the
[kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html) library.
We can refer to the
[Type-Safe Builders](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html)
article for an explanation of Type-Safe builders in Kotlin.

Our next step is to add the `src/jsMain/kotlin/main.kt` file
with the following contents

```kotlin
import kotlinx.html.dom.append
import kotlinx.html.js.*
import kotlin.browser.document

const val jvmBackend = "http://127.0.0.1:8888"

fun main() {
  document.getElementById("app")
          ?.also { it.innerHTML = "" }
          ?.append {
            h1 { +"Kotlin Fractals" }
            h2 { +"JS Edition" }
            img(src = "$jvmBackend/mandelbrot")
          }
}
```

## Running the App

Now it's time to start both the server-side JVM process,
by running the `run` task in Gradle, and the client-side
part by running the `jsRun` task (please note, it may
not work on Windows due to a known bug). Both these Gradle tasks
will run servers for us (a Ktor server for the JVM and a
webpack dev server for the JS), we don't expect these tasks
to complete. Terminating these tasks will stop the dev servers. 


If it all works, we should be able to see something
similar in the web browser:

## Completed Code

We may use the `step-003` branch of the
[github.com/kotlin-hands-on/intro-mpp](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/intro-mpp)
repository as the solution of the tasks that we done above. 
We may also just download the
[archive](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/intro-mpp/archive/step-003.zip)
from GitHub directly.
