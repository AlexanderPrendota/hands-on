# Creating JavaScript Target

We've tried calling different URLs from the JVM backend to see
different [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)
images, like
![](./assets/mandelbrot-zoom2.png)

It is a bit hard to deal with the 2D space coordinates manually,
and our goal is to create a more user-friendly HTML interface
for that. 

The client-side JavaScript application that we are about to
build can be done fully with Kotlin/JS. Let's start with
an HTML layout rendered via
[kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html).

```note
We are using experimantal Kotlin Multiplatform Gradle plugin
with the experimental Kotlin/JS support. Right now it
does not support running on Windows operation system. 
[Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)
can be used to execute targets
```

## Adding Gradle Target

We need to add the `js()` target into the `build.gradle.kts` file
in the `kotlin{}` block. The resulting block should look like that

```kotlin
kotlin {
  jvm()
  js {
    browser()
  }
}
```

## Adding Kotlin/JS Dependencies

Now it is time to add Kotlin/JS dependencies to the project by
adding the following code to the `build.gradle.kts` project file:

```kotlin
kotlin.sourceSets["jsMain"].dependencies {
  implementation(kotlin("stdlib-js"))
  implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-html-js:0.6.12")
}
```

These lines add a dependency to a Kotlin/JS standard library and
to the HTML dsl library. Now we are ready to add JS code
to the project.

We may need to refresh the Gradle project model now to make sure
the IDE sees all our project model changes

## Adding index.html

Yet another preparation step is to add the `index.html`
to the project. Let's create the 
`src/jsMain/resources/index.html` file on our project
with the following contents
```html
<html lang="en">
<body>
<div id="app">Loading...</div>
<script src="kotlin-fractals2-handson.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
We may include CSS styles to the HTML file to make it look
less ugly. One may checkout the `step-003` branch of the
[github.com/kotlin-hands-on/intro-mpp](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/intro-mpp)
repository for more insights.

## Rendering HTML from Kotlin/JS

Let's render the basic HTML using
[kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html).
We may refer to the
[Type-Safe Builders](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/type-safe-builders.html)
article for the explanation on the Type-Safe builders in Kotlin.

Our next step is to add the `src/jsMain/kotlin/main.kt` file
with the following contents

```kotlin
import kotlinx.html.dom.append
import kotlinx.html.js.*
import kotlin.browser.document

const val jvmBackend = "http://127.0.0.1:8888"

fun main() {
  document.getElementById("app")
          ?.also { it.innerHTML = "" }
          ?.append {
            h1 { +"Kotlin Fractals" }
            h2 { +"JS Edition" }
            img(src = "$jvmBackend/mandelbrot")
          }
}
```

## Running the App

Now it is time to start both the server-side JVM process,
by running the `run` task in Gradle, and the client-side
part by running the `jsRun` task (please note, it may
now work on Windows due to a known bug).

It is all works, we should be able to see something
similar on the web browser

## Completed Code

We may use the `step-003` branch of the
[github.com/kotlin-hands-on/intro-mpp](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/intro-mpp)
repository as the solution of the tasks that we done above. 
We may also just download the
[archive](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/intro-mpp/archive/step-003.zip)
from GitHub directly.
