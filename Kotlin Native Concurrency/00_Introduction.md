# Introduction

**This Kotlin Hands-on Tutorial was contributed by [Kevin Galligan](https://github.com/kpgalligan) from [Touchlab](https://touchlab.co/). Thanks, Kevin!**

To better understand the state rules of Kotlin/Native, we'll walk you through some example code. For this hands-on, you'll need a recent version of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Ideally version 2020.1, Community or Ultimate Edition. Android Studio will likely work, but may have some config issues.

Clone the sample code repository:

[kotlin-hands-on/KNConcurrencyHandson](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/KNConcurrencyHandson)

Once cloned, open the sample project in IntelliJ IDEA ([video](https://youtu.be/kU8jj6kdqXo)).

The sample library will build a command line application on Mac, Linux, or Windows. All of the code samples exist in the sample project. We'll be running them one by one and discussing how they work.
