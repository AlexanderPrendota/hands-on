# Creating the KMM project

The KMM plugin for Android Studio includes a "New Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile Project" wizard. With this wizard, we will create the structure for our new project in just a few clicks.

In Android Studio, we first need to select **File** | **New** | **New Project** and select KMM Application in the list of project templates. Next, we need to specify a name for our new project. On the last step, we can keep the default names for the applications and shared module. Click finish and youâ€™re all done!

To view the complete structure of our mobile multiplatform project, let's switch the view from Android to Project.

You can explore the features [included in your project](https://helpserver.labs.jb.gg/help/kotlin-mobile/discover-kmm-project.html) and how to use them, or you can go directly to the next step and start coding!

Here's the [Git commit](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/kmm-networking-and-data-storage/commit/57964ab4f1243799dc84d3bbe2b97b8fd6ef8a14) with the KMM project created and configured. Now we are ready to start developing our multiplatform application.
